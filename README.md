## Description

- This project was made using Javascript, Node.js.  I was motivated to build this project to improve my comprehension of MongoDB and Mongoose syntax.  It was built because I wanted to practice with these coding languages to help improve my understanding  It is intended to solve the problem of not being able to connect with friends to help with coding problems.  In making said project, I learned good practices when working on back-end development with MongoDB and Mongoose.
